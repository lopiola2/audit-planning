# Level 0 â€“ Still Planning Audits in Word?

Are you planning audits by writing tables in Word and copying them between years? Youâ€™re not alone â€” but this approach is risky, messy, and not future-proof.

## Why Word-Based Planning Fails

- No error prevention (duplicate audits, missing units)
- No structure (hard to extract anything later)
- Version chaos (audit plan v4_FINAL_2024_REALLY.docx)

## First Step: Move to Basic Excel

If youâ€™re not ready for automation, thatâ€™s fine. But switching to a **basic Excel template** (with no formulas!) is already a major win.
